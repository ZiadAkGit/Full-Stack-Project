				Finding your perfect canine companion is an exciting journey! Our
				adoption process is designed to match dogs with loving families and
				create lasting bonds. Learn about the steps involved, from application
				to home visits. When you adopt from Paws Haven Rescue, you're not just
				gaining a furry friend you're becoming part of a community that cares.
				Find out what's included in our adoption packages, including
				vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and more.
